So, on the TikTok platform, there is a trend of coding according to lyrics using platforms, such as Google Colab and VS Code. I was interested in joining the trend, and I made the trend using the Kaggle Notebook platform which contains two songs: Somebody's Pleasure (Aziz Hedra) and Tante Culik Aku Dong (Gomez Lx). Made just for fun haha!
